5- Method Signature (required time:2min)
your colleague wrote a function to calculate something, unfortunately he didn’t choose a good name for it, so you don’t know what it does. But from the way that he used it, can you guess how does it look like?

var (averageSalary, numberOfEmployee) = await SomeCalculation(0L, 10L, 0L == 10L);

Answer: 

As far as, my understanding is concered this function is implemented in a Tuple style i.e it will return multiple values and assigned them to respective
defined variables (new feature in c# 7.0).

3 arguments are being passed to function:

1st: 0L ==> passed 0 as long)
2nd 10L ==> passed 10 as long
3rd: 0L == 10L ==> it will be evaluated as 'false'
